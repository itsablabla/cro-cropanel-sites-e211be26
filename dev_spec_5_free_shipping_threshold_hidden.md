# Free Shipping Threshold Hidden — dev spec
Site: allbirds.com · Priority 5 · High · Effort: Medium (2-5 days)

## Problem
The homepage hero promotes 'Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural.' without mentioning the $100 free shipping threshold, which is only disclosed in the sitewide banner, creating an expectation of free shipping that may not be met for lower-priced items.

## Evidence (from the live site)
> Homepage hero copy: 'Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural.'; sitewide banner: 'Free ground shipping on orders over $100'.

## Current state
h1: Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural.; cta: SHOP MEN / SHOP WOMEN; notes: No mention of shipping threshold in hero or CTAs.

## Required change
h1: Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural. Free Shipping Over $100.; cta: SHOP MEN / SHOP WOMEN; notes: Include free shipping threshold in hero or near CTAs to set accurate expectations.
